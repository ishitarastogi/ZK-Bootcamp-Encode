# Modular Arithmetic

**Modular Arithmetic also known as Clock Arithmetic.**


**Q1.** For set of Integers S={0,1,2,3,4,5,6}

1. What is 4+4 ?
Refrencing to clock image pointing the arrow to four and then move 4 steps forward, its 1.

Integer mod 7
8 mod 7 =1

2. What is 3x5 ?
Refrencing to clock image again pointing the arrow to 3 move it 3 steps forward 4 times we get 1.

Integer mod 7
15 mod 7=1

3. what is the inverse of 3 ?
Opposite element is called Inverse. So Inverse of 3 is -3.

-3 mod 7
To get the remainder we have to find the number which is closest to -3 and divisible by 7 which is basically -7.
-7 is closest and less than -3 and also divisible by 7.

so -3 mod 7 = 4

**Q2.** For S = {0,1,2,3,4,5,6}
Can we consider 'S' and the operation '+' to be a group ?

No, because it doesn't follow closure property which is, For all a, b in S, the result of the operation, a â€¢ b, is also in S.
For example, if a=3 and b=6
Then a+b=> 6+3=9
9 doesn't lie in set S.

- It follows associative and has an identiti which is zero but does not have the inverse property as negatives of 1 to 6 are not present.

**Q3.** 3. What is
-13 mod 5 ?
-15 is closest and less than -13 and also divisible by 5.
So, -13 mod 5 =2
